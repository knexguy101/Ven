## Ven [Documentation](https://knexguy101.github.io/Ven/)

Ven is a scripting language that allows users to easily automate the [Venari](https://app.legendsofvenari.com/expedition) game without touching http or web based code. Ven takes inspiration from Assembly in terms of structuring, and allows users to do difficult or complex tasks with prebuilt `Actions`

### Quickstart

2. Put Ven.exe into `C:\Ven` or `C:\Users\username\Ven`
3. (Optional) put `Ven.exe` in your system's PATH to make reference easier
4. Open Command Prompt
5. `$ cd Ven`
6. Create your scripts within this folder
7. `$ ven run scriptname.ven` in order to run your script
8. (Optional) If Ven is inside your PATH, scripts can be ran from anywhere on your PC
